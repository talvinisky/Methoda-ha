# Methoda Homework Assignment 

### This project was done as a part of my application process to Methoda.
### This project aims to deploy Jira,Confluence and jenkins using docker-compose  
### And leverage Jenkins to automate the process of moving Jira issues to solved when git merger happends

# Please keep in mind:
I wasnt able to create a web hook because the git webhooks dont support using a url like "Localhost:8080"
so you will need to create it yourself inorder to see the project work in its fullest 
as well as configure jira and confluence
My host System is MacOS with an ARM chip and the setup is configured to fit my system 

# In order to use this project please keep make sure you have a docker daemon installed
